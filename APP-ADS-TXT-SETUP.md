# App-ads.txt Setup Guide for Qibla Compass

## üîç **What is app-ads.txt?**

App-ads.txt is a text file that helps prevent ad fraud by publicly declaring which companies are authorized to sell your app's ad inventory. It's required by Google AdMob for verification.

## üìã **Your app-ads.txt Content**

Based on your AdMob publisher ID `pub-2744970719381152`, create a file named `app-ads.txt` with the following content:

```
google.com, pub-2744970719381152, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0
```
