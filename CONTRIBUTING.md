## Coding Standards

### File Organization
- Follow the structure in PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
- Place files in appropriate folders
- Use feature-based organization

### Naming Conventions
- Files: `snake_case.dart`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Variables/Functions: `camelCase`
- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` or `camelCase` for private

### Code Style
- Follow Dart style guide
- Use `flutter analyze` to check for issues
- Format code with `dart format .`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### State Management
- Use GetX controllers for state
- Use GetX bindings for dependency injection
- Keep business logic in controllers
- Keep UI code in views

### Best Practices
1. **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully
2. **Logging**: Use Logger utility instead of print
3. **Performance**: Optimize for low-end devices
4. **Offline Support**: Ensure features work offline when possible
5. **Accessibility**: Follow accessibility guidelines
6. **Testing**: Write tests for critical functionality
7. **Documentation**: Document complex code and APIs
